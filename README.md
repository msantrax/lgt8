# LGT8 Project

####Full information about the project may be found at the portfolio pages :  <a href='https://msantrax.github.io/lgt8/lgt8.html' target="_blank">LGT8 Project Page at Portfolio Site</a>
<p>This project was requested by <a href='http://www.acpinstruments.com.br' target="_blank">ACP Instruments Manufatura Ltda.</a> and
    <a href='https://www.acilweber.com.br/' target="_blank">Acil Weber Equipamentos Cient√≠ficos Ltda.</a>  at the first quarter of 2013
    in order to meet the needs of its client (CIA Vale do Rio Doce) regarding the modernization of one of its instruments in operation in the laboratory.
    The instrument in question (precision polisher for geological samples from <a href='https://logitech.uk.com/product/pm6-precision-lapping-polishing-system/'>Logitech UK</a>)
    was dawn due to lack of replacement material (declared obsolescence). In order to recover its functioning, the following goals were established:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Replacement of all control electronics by microprocessor systems.</li>
    <li>Review of all mechanics, repair of fairings and accessories.</li>
    <li>Creation of a modern user interface via tablets/android.</li>
    <li>Implementation of the possibility of manual operations if desired.</li>
    <li>Increased accuracy (50%) of the concavity measurement on the roughing table.</li>
    <li>Provide the user with tools for creating more complex methods via a graphical interface.</li>
    <li>Provide possibility for the system to autonomously (via machine learning) estimate a better strategy for roughing and polishing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As a primary support to the sales team and production teams, a simple guidance draft and a worksheet estimating man-hours per development
    unit were sent to the contracting party in order to guide the construction of the commercial proposal to the final customer and the project
    was approved. These documents can be accessed at <a href="logitechMHM.pdf" target="_blank">Men/Hour Map - LGT8 Project</a> e

</p>
<p>Once the goals were established, the research phase to build the knowledge base and the reverse engineering of the legacy systems
    were carried out in order to support the construction of the architecture of the new system. The theoretical research on the physical processes
    inherent to the operation of the instrument can be accessed at <a href='#' target="_blank">LGT8 Lap&Polishin Theory</a>
